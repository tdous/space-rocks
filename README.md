# space-rocks
 Space Rocks is a wholly original 2D game concept in which a player ship flies around shooting space rocks into smaller pieces and trying not to get hit and killed in the process. I'm sure there's a name for this kind of rock but I can't think of it right now. It'll come to me. Space rocks.
